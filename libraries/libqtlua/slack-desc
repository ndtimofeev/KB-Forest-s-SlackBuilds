# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libqtlua: libqtlua (Lua API for QObject)
libqtlua:
libqtlua: The QtLua library aims to make Qt5 applications scriptable using the
libqtlua: Lua scripting language. It is an alternative to the QtScript module.
libqtlua: QtLua does not generate or use generated binding code for Qt. Instead
libqtlua: it provides useful C++ wrapper classes to make C++ and lua objects
libqtlua: accessible from both lua and C++. It takes advantages of the Qt meta
libqtlua: object system to expose QObject members to lua scripts.
